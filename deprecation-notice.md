Hello Beyondsoft Calendar users,

You're here because you have started seeing this warning attached to the Beyondsoft Calendar visual:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13630322/154092409-2d87ba16-2000-4a59-961d-9acd725f9cf7.png)

The Microsoft Power BI team has made me aware of errors that the visual is surfacing via their telemtry reports. Unfortunately, I haven't had any bandwidth nor resources to support ongoing development or maintenance of this visual for quite a long time now. On account of this, the Power BI team has added the "deprecated" tag to the visual. However, they inform me that this does not break any reports nor dashboards. It simply adds the info icon to the visual header to notify that the visual is not being maintained. 

Having said that, due to the apparent popularity of this visual, highlighted by the sheer number of communications I am receiving regarding this issue, I have very recently decided to try to carve out some small slices of time where I can work towards getting the visual up to compliance and not throwing the errors it is now. I am making progress towards this goal, it is just slow due to the lack of available time to put towards it. 

Therefore I can't give an exact time to have the code fixes in place, plus getting the update approved and pushed to the AppSource store. If this doesn't meet to your satisfaction, I encourage you to search for alternatives that might still fit your reporting needs. Otherwise, I greatly appreciate your patience as I make slow but steady progress towards an update, which will hopefully be available in the not-too-distant future.

Thank you for choosing my visual to use in your reports!

-Manny
